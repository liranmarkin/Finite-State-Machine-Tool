# declare a label(state) using [name]:
# (i.e name then colon)
q0:
print 0   # print X defines the output of that state as X
on a q1   # when the next character is a jump to label q1
goto q0   # jump to label q0 if didn't jump already (default jump)

q1:  # declares label q1
print 0
on b q2   # if the next character is 'b' jump to q2
on a q1	  # if the next character is 'a' jump to q1
goto q0   # if the next character is non of the above jump to q0

q2:
print 1   # print 1 means accepting state in that example
on a q1
goto q0

# this example is a machine that accepts words that end with "ab".
